<h1>rules</h1>
<p>Sprat is similar to Solitaire, but the "win" conditions are a bit different: 
The goal of the game is to get rid of your sprat deck -- there are 13 cards, and you only see the top one.

<p>The ace piles almost work like in Solitaire: 
You play cards that match suit in increasing order. 
The difference is that the ace piles are shared between all players!
If any player movesÎ© an Ace of Hearts to the ace piles, you can play your two of hearts on top of it.
If two players have a two of hearts, both can play but only one can win, so the game is meant to be fast paced!

<p>The piles section is a "staging area" where only you can play.
You can place cards (e.g. from the sprat deck or flip deck) in descending order and alternating suit-color.
So you can play a black ten on a red Jack.
You can also move the entire pile or a sub-pile to another pile.
So if you you have a pile with a red Jack and black ten, you can move both cards to a black Queen.
(To do this in the game, click the red Jack.)

<p>Cards from the top of the flip deck can be played anywhere, or you can flip the next three cards over.
You can see the history, but can only play the topmost card (rightmost in the current implementation).
This is to tantalize you with the cards you can almost play, but can't.

<p>Scoring works as follows:
When any player gets a "sprat!" (they have exhausted their sprat deck), the score of each player for that round is the number of cards they have played on the ace piles minus twice the number of cards left in their sprat deck.
Negative scores are possible but should be avoided as the goal is to get a high score.

<p>Tips:
<ul>
    <li>The sprat deck turns over infrequently enough that it's easy to forget about it. But getting rid of the sprat deck is the only way to win, and each card left in your sprat deck hurts.</li>
    <li>It's tempting to try to prevent other players from playing on "your cards" by focusing on the piles instead of the ace piles, but your only source of points is exactly the cards you get on the ace piles, so resist that temptation.</li>
</ul>

<h1>bugs</h1>
<ul>
    <li>can click a card in the middle of a pile, it will move without moving the cards that bury it</li>
</ul>
